world went away the whole world went away the whole world went away the day the whole world went away 
so impressed with all you do tried so hard to be like you flew too high and burnt the wing lost my faith in everything lick around divine 
debris taste the wealth of hate in me shedding skin succumb defeat this machine is obsolete made the choice to go away drink the fountain of 
decay tear a hole exquisite red fuck the rest and stab it dead broken bruised forgotten sore too fucked up to care anymore poisoned to my 
rotten core too fucked up to care anymore broken bruised forgotten sore too fucked up to care anymore poisoned to my rotten core too fucked up 
to care anymore in the back off the side far away is a place where i hide where i stay tried to say tried to ask i needed to all alone by 
myself where were you how could i ever think it's funny how everything that swore it wouldn't change is different now just like you would 
always say we'll make it through then my head fell apart and where were you how could i ever think it's funny how everything you swore would 
never change is different now like you said you and me make it through didn't quite fell apart where the fuck were you

might be true and you know me well you think you do sometimes i have everything yet i wish i felt something do you know how far this has gone 
just how damaged have i become when i think i can overcome it runs even deeper in a dream i'm a different me with a perfect you we fit 
perfectly for once in my life i feel complete and i still wanna ruin it afraid to look as clear as day this plan has long been underway i hear 
them call i cannot stay the voice inviting me away do you know how far this has gone just how damaged have i become when i think i can 
overcome it runs even deeper everything that matters is gone everything that matters is gone all the hands of hope have withdrawn everything 
could you try to help me hang on it runs i'm straight i won't crack on my way and i can't turn back i'm okay i'm on track on my way and i 
can't turn back i stayed on this track gone to far and i can't come back i stayed on this track lost my way can't come back i stayed on this 
track gone to far and i can't come back i stayed on this track lost my way can't come back i stayed on this track gone to far and i can't come

calling me keep on calling me they keep calling me where figures from the past stand tall and mocking voices ring above imperialistic house of 
prayer conquistadors who took their share they keep calling me keep on calling me they keep calling me keep on calling me calling me calling 
me calling me calling me they keep calling me keep on calling me they keep calling me keep on calling me they keep calling me keep on calling 
me they keep calling me keep on calling me

small to see but i watched it way too long it was pulling me down i was up above it i was up above it now i'm down in it i was up above it i 
was up above it now i'm down in it shut up so what what does it matter now i was swimming in the haze now i crawl on the ground and everything

staring at the sea will she come is there hope for me after all is said and done anything at any price all of this for you all the spoils of a 
wasted life all of this for you all the world has closed her eyes tired faith all worn and thin for all we could have done and all that could

that you know he used to have feelings but the blood has stopped pumping and he is left to decay the me that you know is now made up of wires 
and even when i'm right with you i'm so far away i can try to get away but i've strapped myself in i can try to scratch away the sound in my 
ears i can see it killing away all of my bad parts i don't want to listen but it's all too clear hiding backwards inside of me i feel so 
unafraid annie hold a little tighter i might just slip away it won't give up it wants me dead and goddamn this noise inside my head it won't

someone take these dreams away that point me to another day a duel of personality the stranger true reality they keep calling me they keep 
calling me keep on calling me they keep calling me where figures from the past stand tall and mocking voices ring above imperialistic house of 
prayer conquistadors who took their share they keep calling me keep on calling me they keep calling me keep on calling me calling me calling 
me calling me calling me they keep calling me keep on calling me they keep calling me keep on calling me they keep calling me keep on calling 
me they keep calling me keep on calling me 
now i'm down in it now i'm down in it kinda like a cloud i was up way up in the sky and i was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe 
sometimes i don't believe them myself and i decided i was never coming down just then a tiny little dot caught my eye it was just about too 
small to see but i watched it way too long it was pulling me down i was up above it i was up above it now i'm down in it i was up above it i 
was up above it now i'm down in it shut up so what what does it matter now i was swimming in the haze now i crawl on the ground and everything 
i never liked about you is kind of seeping into me try to laugh about it now but isn't it funny how everything works out i guess the jokes on 
me she said i was up above it i was up above it now i'm down in it i was up above it i was up above it now i'm down in it i used to be so big 
and strong i used to know my right from wrong i used to never be afraid i used to be somebody i used to have something inside now just this 
hole that's open wide i used to want it all i used to be somebody i'll cross my heart i'll hope to die but the needle's already in my eye and 
all the world's weight is on my back and i don't even know why what i used to think was me is just a fading memory i looked him right in the

think i used to have a voice now i never make a sound and i just do what i've been told i really don't want them to come around oh no every 
day is exactly the same every day is exactly the same there is no love here and there is no pain every day is exactly the same i can feel 
their eyes are watching in case i lose myself again sometimes i think i'm happy here sometimes sometimes yet i still pretend i can't remember 
how this got started but i can tell you exactly how it will end every day is exactly the same every day is exactly the same there is no love 
here and there is no pain every day is exactly the same i'm writing on a little piece of paper i'm hoping someday you might find well i'll 
hide it behind something they won't look behind i am still inside you a little bit comes bleeding through i wish this could have been any 
other way but i just don't know i don't know what else i can do every day is exactly the same every day is exactly the same there is no love

off your knees are you brave enough to see do you wanna change it what if this all crusade's a charade and behind it all there's a price to be 
paid for the blood which we dine justified in the name of the holy and the divine just how deep do you believe will you bite the hand that 
feeds will you chew until it bleeds can you get up off your knees are you brave enough to see do you wanna change it so naive I keep holding 
on to what i wanna believe I can see but i keep holding on and on and on and on will you bite the hand that feeds you will you stay down on
